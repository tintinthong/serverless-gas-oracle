# serverless-gas-station

Have you ever used a public gas station but get "FeeTooLow" errors? 
Have you had to use a hardcoded `gasPrice` value because testnets don't host a gas station? 
Have you wondered why gas stations don't return values like `maxPriorityFee`(an EIP1559 standard)? 

Gas station service that is hosted on AWS Lambda.
